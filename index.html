<h1>Ryan Loera</h1>
<p>I am <em>Ryan Loera</em>, I'm currently enrolled in the Wood Manufacturing Technology program at Cerritos College. 
    I would like to pursue furniture desgin and table making to hopefully one day opening my own shop.
    I am a certified welder and used to work on highrise buildings. I currently practice pottery and sell them on etsy. 
    My experience with coding has been a month of self teaching on freeCodeCamp doing the HTML/CSS modules. I hope
    to gain more knowledge to create and incorporate all my skills into bigger projects.</p>
<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ol>
    <li>I like to go camping</li>
    <li>Work on creative projects</li>
    <li>Watch movies and TV Shows</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freeCodeCamp</a> because its a free resource that teaches so much.</p>
