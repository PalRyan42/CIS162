        <p >I am <em>Ryan Loera</em>, I'm currently enrolled in the Wood Manufacturing Technology program at Cerritos College. 
    I would like to pursue furniture desgin and table making to hopefully one day opening my own shop.
    I am a certified welder and used to work on highrise buildings. I currently practice pottery and sell them on etsy. 
    My experience with coding has been a month of self teaching on freeCodeCamp doing the HTML/CSS modules. I hope
    to gain more knowledge to create and incorporate all my skills into bigger projects.</p>
